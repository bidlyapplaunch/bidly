# üöÄ Shopify OAuth Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Shopify OAuth for your Bidly Auction App so that each store can authenticate and access their products.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Shopify Partner Account**: You need a Shopify Partner account to create apps
2. **ngrok Account**: For local development tunneling
3. **MongoDB**: For storing store tokens and data

## üîß Step 1: Create a Shopify App

### 1.1 Go to Shopify Partner Dashboard
1. Visit [partners.shopify.com](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Log in with your Shopify Partner account
3. Click **"Apps"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Create app"**

### 1.2 Configure Your App
1. **App name**: `Bidly Auction App` (or your preferred name)
2. **App URL**: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev`
3. **Allowed redirection URL(s)**: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/auth/shopify/callback`

### 1.3 Get Your Credentials
After creating the app, you'll get:
- **API key** (Client ID)
- **API secret key** (Client Secret)

## üåê Step 2: Set Up ngrok

### 2.1 Install ngrok
```bash
# Download from https://ngrok.com/download
# Or install via package manager
npm install -g ngrok
```

### 2.2 Start ngrok
```bash
# Start ngrok on your backend port
ngrok http 5000
```

### 2.3 Get Your ngrok URL
Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.dev`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

### 3.1 Create `.env` file
Create a `.env` file in your `auction-backend` directory:

```bash
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/bidly-auctions

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Shopify OAuth Configuration
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_partner_dashboard
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_from_partner_dashboard
SHOPIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/auth/shopify/callback

# Email Configuration (for notifications)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### 3.2 Update App URLs in Shopify
1. Go back to your Shopify Partner Dashboard
2. Edit your app
3. Update the **App URL** to your ngrok URL
4. Update the **Allowed redirection URL(s)** to include your callback URL

## üöÄ Step 4: Test the OAuth Flow

### 4.1 Start Your Backend
```bash
cd auction-backend
npm run dev
```

### 4.2 Test Installation
1. Visit: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/auth/shopify/install?shop=your-test-store.myshopify.com`
2. You should be redirected to Shopify's OAuth page
3. After approval, you'll be redirected back to your app
4. Check your MongoDB to see the store record created

### 4.3 Test Product Fetching
```bash
# Test the Shopify API with your store
curl "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/api/shopify/products?shop=your-test-store.myshopify.com&limit=5"
```

## üîç Step 5: Verify Everything Works

### 5.1 Check Store Installation
```bash
curl "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/auth/shopify/status?shop=your-test-store.myshopify.com"
```

### 5.2 Test Product Search
```bash
curl "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/api/shopify/search?shop=your-test-store.myshopify.com&q=test"
```

### 5.3 Check Service Status
```bash
curl "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/api/shopify/status?shop=your-test-store.myshopify.com"
```

## üèóÔ∏è Step 6: Update Frontend

### 6.1 Update Admin Frontend
The admin frontend needs to include the shop parameter in all API calls:

```javascript
// In your API calls, add the shop parameter
const response = await api.get(`/api/shopify/products?shop=${shopDomain}`);
```

### 6.2 Update Customer Frontend
The customer frontend should also include the shop parameter for consistency.

## üîê Step 7: Security Considerations

### 7.1 HMAC Verification
The OAuth flow includes HMAC verification to ensure requests are from Shopify.

### 7.2 Token Storage
- Access tokens are stored securely in MongoDB
- Tokens are not included in API responses
- Each store has its own isolated token

### 7.3 Webhook Security
- Uninstall webhooks are handled automatically
- Store status is updated when apps are uninstalled

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Store not found" Error
- **Cause**: Store hasn't completed OAuth flow
- **Solution**: Visit the install URL first

#### 2. "Invalid HMAC" Error
- **Cause**: Request signature verification failed
- **Solution**: Check your API secret key

#### 3. "Redirect URI mismatch" Error
- **Cause**: Callback URL doesn't match what's configured in Shopify
- **Solution**: Update the redirect URI in your Shopify app settings

#### 4. "Access denied" Error
- **Cause**: Store owner didn't approve the app
- **Solution**: Try the installation flow again

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if store is installed
curl "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/auth/shopify/status?shop=your-store.myshopify.com"

# Test connection
curl "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/api/shopify/test?shop=your-store.myshopify.com"

# Get service status
curl "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.dev/api/shopify/status?shop=your-store.myshopify.com"
```

## üìö API Endpoints

### OAuth Endpoints
- `GET /auth/shopify/install?shop=store.myshopify.com` - Start OAuth flow
- `GET /auth/shopify/callback` - OAuth callback (handled by Shopify)
- `GET /auth/shopify/status?shop=store.myshopify.com` - Check installation status
- `GET /auth/shopify/store?shop=store.myshopify.com` - Get store info

### Shopify API Endpoints (all require `?shop=store.myshopify.com`)
- `GET /api/shopify/products` - Get all products
- `GET /api/shopify/search?q=query` - Search products
- `GET /api/shopify/products/:id` - Get specific product
- `GET /api/shopify/status` - Get service status
- `GET /api/shopify/test` - Test connection

## üéâ Success!

Once everything is working:
1. ‚úÖ Stores can install your app via OAuth
2. ‚úÖ Each store's access token is stored securely
3. ‚úÖ Your app can fetch products from each store
4. ‚úÖ The auction system works with real Shopify products
5. ‚úÖ Multiple stores can use your app simultaneously

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Update your production environment variables
2. **Set Up Webhooks**: Configure additional Shopify webhooks if needed
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track which stores are using your app
4. **Add Features**: Extend the app with more Shopify integrations
